DH8oOZEMz6w,plaicnhko,"The entire pricing concept of the Nintendo Switch 2 is unattractive.
Contrary to most opinions, the console itself is too expensive—especially considering what it can’t do compared to other handhelds like the Steam Deck. A maximum of €400 would’ve been reasonable. Instead, we already have outdated hardware again that won’t be able to run next-gen games.

Then: The C button on the console costs extra — EXCUSE ME?
What you get is a video chat feature that feels like it’s from 1998. If they add a printer next, we’ll finally have the successor to the Game Boy Camera and Printer.
Do we at least have drift-free sticks this time?
Another thick display bezel? That’s just not state of the art.
No improvements in ergonomics. What’s the point of a thinner console? No one cares about that with the Steam Deck because it’s more comfortable to hold.
Backwards compatibility for Switch games is tied to a paid patch for €20 each — if there’s even one available. You can’t just play Switch 1 games out of the box.
I’ve got tons of digital games I can’t even access without a Switch Why on earth should Mario Kart cost €90? Who’s going to convince me that this game is more complex than a Forza Horizon?
Why should any Nintendo game be worth more than €60 — apart from a few rare exceptions?
A Pro Controller for €90???
A 460p camera for €60???

Once again, you need to buy tons of expensive accessories just to get the gaming experience other platforms give you from day one.

What we’re seeing here is a corporation that can’t get enough and now wants to dig even deeper into the pockets of loyal customers. I’m completely out unless Nintendo makes a U-turn here.

And as consumers, we have the power. Don’t let yourselves get ripped off, folks.",35

¿Cómo preparar receta?
Preparación
Sopaipillas de zapallo:
Cocinar el zapallo en abundante agua hasta que esté muy suave, aproximadamente 30 minutos a fuego medio.
Pasar el zapallo por un colador fino. Mezclar con el resto de los ingredientes hasta formar una masa homogénea. Envolver en film y dejar descansar por 30 minutos a temperatura ambiente.
Estirar la masa hasta que tenga 3mm de grosor sobre una superficie enharinada. Cortar círculos de 5cm de diámetro con un corta pasta. Con un tenedor, marcar tres veces cada sopaipilla.
Precalentar el aceite a fuego medio o hasta que llegue a 180C.
Agregar las sopaipillas al aceite y freír hasta que estén doradas, aproximadamente 4-5 minutos. Solo agrega unas 5-6 sopaipillas a la vez para evitar que se enfríe el aceite.
A medida que salen del aceite, ponerlas sobre una rejilla con una bandeja abajo para atrapar el exceso de aceite.
Sopaipillas de betarraga:
Cocinar la betarraga en abundante agua hasta que esté muy suave, aproximadamente 30 minutos a fuego medio.
Pasar la betarraga por un colador fino. Mezclar con el resto de los ingredientes hasta formar una masa homogénea. Envolver en film y dejar descansar por 30 minutos a temperatura ambiente.

DH8oOZEMz6w,wilbur.lewis.lu,"Hey Nintendo.  I have multiple units of every system, along with multiple copies of the same games, since your first system.  But now, you've gotten quite greedy with not only your pricing, but how you sell games as well.  You're now fake selling us ""hard"" copies of the games that we want.  By selling us the ""game cartridge"" that is nothing more than a digital key to give us access to the download, which we didn't want in the first place because we didn't want to use up the onboard memory on our systems!  Or, we might have wanted to trade games with a friend for the weekend. 
 Or, and heaven forbid it, we might have wanted to sell an old game we no longer wanted to play to be able to purchase a new game!  So, in essence, these ""hard"" copies of the games that we want are ninety dollars, while the digital download versions are ""only"" eighty dollars.  BUT (and that's a big but!), the ""hard"" copy is the EXACT same digital download as the cheaper digital download!  How does this even make sense?  This is exactly how ""big"" gaming companies go down into nothingness.  First, you screwed up with Sony and gave them the PlayStation.  Now you're screwing over your own customer base with over pricing every single element of the Switch 2.  Ninety-dollar games?  Oh, there have been other screw ups, but this one now takes the cake.  Nope.  I will not purchase a single one.  No thanks.  I won't be purchasing this, and I will recommend to my friends and family to go with the Steam Deck instead.  Someone at Nintendo needs to be fired for the sheer audacity of everything wrong with this new system.  TOO MUCH GREED IN NINTENDO TODAY!",0

•Charging for upgrades for performance increase etc when 60fps should be the STANDARD in 2025, is crazy to me. Mind you, if you overclock your switch or have performance mods, you can already get games to run at a near 60fps. Mind you, it won’t be a stable 60fps, but its still better than playing in an unstable 30fps.

•Added an in game chat and share feature that is incredibly stupid. We have discord, etc that does all that for FREE. Don’t even get me started on the 5ps trash quality that is the game screen share. 

Charging for a game that teaches you about the console when it should have just been included is just greed. (Not that I think most would buy it anyway, but it’s the disrespect of it all that is baffling.)

The switch 2 is a console that is just catching up with the industry’s current standards and it’s incredibly disappointing.

DH8oOZEMz6w,flying_buffalo0166,I honestly don't mind the pricing. I've had a Switch since day one and only own about 10 games for it physically. I play Playstation and PC too so not all of my gaming is done there. If the games are great and justify that price then I'm OK with it. With Mario Kart world releasing on day one it will likely be another 7+ years before we get another one. Is it really so wrong to chare that considering many buy the newest EA Sports game or Call of Duty year after year for $60 a pop? Not to mention too that if they take a similar approach as they did with 8 Deluxe and include DLC with the price of Nintendo Switch Online (which you undoubtedly have if you play Mario Kart) then that extends the life of the game at no additional cost aside from a slightly pricier initial payment.,0

Why charge for the Nintendo switch 2 tour game? This should be included with the console.

DH8oOZEMz6w,thisistylertaylor,"Hey guys, here is this laggy “new” feature where you can chat with friends and family while playing games and share your screen with them on the Switch without having a separate app on your phone. God Nintendo loves to sell features that others have been doing for 20+ years and act like it’s some huge advancement in tech. OH, and here’s this “game” that comes out the day the Switch 2 releases and helps you get familiar with the switch 2 and how it works!!! But you have to pay for it. Nintendo has been a joke for over a decade. They don’t care about their customers and bank on you just caving on the FOMO especially the people that are die hard fans that love to buy the same 30 year old games at full price every year. Keep in mind they also really hate the die fans that love Mario Kart/smash bros since they keep shutting down tournaments. Also also, never forget when Nintendo wouldn’t let anyone post anything Nintendo related on YouTube without being part of their special program and if you weren’t and posted anyways they would copyright strike you!

DH8oOZEMz6w,analog.momooo,"$450 standard $500 MK World bundle. How in 2008 could the DSi have a built in camera but in 2025 the Switch 2 can’t I don’t know. I was really hoping the next Switch would have that and the construction quality of the OLED given how successful the 1 did. The lack of original titles and is disappointing besides MK only Deltarune 3+4, Borderlands 4, Hyrule Warriors and a few others look worth it. They had 8 years for this and sold at millions of units. You have to upgrade your Switch 1 library by purchasing a digital upgrade. The console is 1080p 120FPS handled, dock mode 4K HDR 120FPS. The joy cons now both can function as a mouse and only ome game cartridge is needed to “stream” the game for@friends to use as well. No interal SD cards anymore which is the biggest shame here. Hopefully that changes before launch or we get an accessory through Type-C. Built in surround sound handheld and the same thickness but a larger screen. Sorry for the rant but hope this sums up most things new. I personally think just the fact our Switch 1 library won’t be directly backward compatible from launch day is all that sucks. The external camera will age to consumers like the Kinect and is literally what Xbox did for the predecessor of the Kinect (Xbox Vision). So close yet so far!

Wii it exceeded expectations in terms of development, FPS, HDR support, storage, backwards compatibility, controls, & third party support capability? Absolutely and absolutely not. Some games will not require you using a mouse for a switch controller. Fortnite is a prime example of mouse gaming support, so I do not know how will work or play out in terms of control support. other games will be the same from the first switch but better graphics, frames per second, and HDR support. As for the storage, this is a massive improvement because if you have a micro SD card you are guaranteed to have that storage capability times the micro sd card that you own. Here’s an example 256 GB worth memory storage  plus 128GB equals to 386GB worth of storage is it worth it? Absolutely will it be better than the Wii U? Absolutely (like button for the analysis)",0
